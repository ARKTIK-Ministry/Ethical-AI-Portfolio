# J. Michael F. Morris - Public Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my diverse work and passions, from technology leadership and ethical AI development to community building and faith-based initiatives. I believe in leveraging technology for good, fostering inclusive entrepreneurship, and serving communities with integrity and compassion.

## About Me

I am a technology leader, advocate, and community builder, driven by a commitment to ethical solutions and unity. My heritage—a blend of African American, Jewish, Italian, and Choctaw roots—deeply influences my dedication to creating a more just and equitable world. My leadership is guided by compassion, collaboration, and a desire to make a meaningful impact.  I am also an ordained minister.

## Areas of Focus

### Ethical AI

I am passionate about developing and promoting ethical AI solutions that prioritize fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. I believe AI should be a force for good, bridging the gap between innovation and human well-being.  My work with ARKTIK and related projects focuses on creating AI-driven solutions aligned with strong ethical standards. For example, ARKTIK Concierge is an AI-powered luxury services platform prioritizing customer privacy and user experience.  Additionally, the IM Bridge Integration project provides a platform to facilitate dialogue and foster understanding within a secure, ethical framework.

### Community Empowerment

I am deeply committed to empowering individuals through entrepreneurship and community service. My work has helped individuals facing adversity create opportunities through entrepreneurial pursuits.  The ARKTIK Global Initiative (AGI) provides workshops, training, and resources for underserved communities through a hybrid non-profit and for-profit model.

### Faith-Based and Social Impact Initiatives

Guided by my faith, I have led numerous initiatives focused on uplifting communities through compassion, collaboration, and service.  These efforts reflect a mission to drive positive change and foster unity.  IM Bridge Workshops foster interfaith dialogue, ethical technology discussions, and community building through an inclusive platform.  Collaborative Community Projects bring diverse groups together for impactful social initiatives and faith-driven volunteerism.
